# Create an app submission for your MSI or EXE app

> [!NOTE]
> MSI and EXE support in the Microsoft Store is currently in a limited public preview phase. As the size of the preview expands, we'll be adding new participants from the wait list. To join the wait list, click [here](https://aka.ms/storepreviewwaitlist).

Once you've created your app by reserving a name, you can start working on getting it published. The first step is to create a submission.

You can start your submission when your app is complete and ready to publish, or you can start entering info before you have written a single line of code. Updates you make to your submission are saved, so you can come back and work on it whenever you're ready.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have an active developer account in Partner Center in order to submit apps to the Microsoft Store. All the users added to your developer account in Partner Center can submit apps to the Microsoft Store. They can also modify any of the existing EXE or MSI apps in Partner Center. The roles and permissions set for account users currently do not apply in case of EXE or MSI apps.

After your app is published, you can publish an updated version by creating another submission in Partner Center. Creating a new submission lets you make  whatever changes are needed, whether you're providing new packages or just changing details such as What’s new or Description. To create a new submission for a published app, click Update next to the most recent submission shown on its Overview page. You can also remove an app from the Store if you need to (and then make it available again later if you'd like).
